Phpass Starter is an easy way to learn more about and get started with [Phpass](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/).

The purpose of this project is to get more developers to move away from functions such as `md5();` that weren't meant for password hashing. Using proper password encryption techniques is now easier thanks to the many frameworks out there such as Phpass, but can seem a bit confusing at first. Phpass Starter is meant to lower the learning curve so that developers of various skills can finally build more secure websites.

# What's Inside
